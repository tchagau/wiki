# C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
